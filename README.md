This app simulates J. H. Conway's cellular automaton "Game of life", see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life for comprehensive article about this.

Cells are generated randomly at start (50% are live, 50% dead), however you can toggle each cell's state by clicking on it (I recommend doing so when the game is paused - with spacebar or the Pause/Break key).
The default grid size is 34*45 cells, you can anytime change it by simply resizing the window of the app (this resets the cells to random state again).

You can control speed of simulation with up and down arrow keys.

Program never ends, you have to terminate it by pressing Q, Alt+F4 or the close button.

You can press F1 anytime for help and info.
